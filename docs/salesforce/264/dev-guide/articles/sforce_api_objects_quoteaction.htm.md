# QuoteAction

Indicates the type of sales transaction that’s being quoted; for
         example, a renewal sale. This object is available in API version 59.0 and
      later.

      

         

If a quote doesn't have a quote action, Salesforce treats it as a quote of the `Add` type. When such a quote is used to create an order,
            Salesforce automatically creates an order action of the `Add` type.
