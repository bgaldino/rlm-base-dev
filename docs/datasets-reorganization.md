## 1. Purpose & Goals

The current `datasets/` folder has accumulated structure organically as new shapes and plans were added. Several structural issues have emerged:

- **Constraints data is QB-specific but lives outside the QB shape folder**, making the QB shape not self-contained
- **Cross-shape plans (`procedure-plans`, `scratch_data`) have no designated home** — they sit as siblings of shape folders inside `sfdmu/`
- **Tooling/operational folders (`reconcile/`, `extractions/`, `test/`, `_archived/`) are mixed with production data**, creating ambiguity about what's reference material vs. working data
- **No registry** linking shape names, locale variants, feature flags, and their plan folders
- **No manifest files** describing each shape's object footprint (prerequisite for Distill integration)

**Goals of this reorganization:**
1. Make each data shape self-contained (SFDMU plans + constraints + shape manifest all co-located)
2. Give cross-shape plans a clear, designated home
3. Separate production data from tooling/operational data
4. Introduce a `shapes.json` registry as the single source of truth for shape discovery
5. Create a natural home for future Distill-generated shapes
6. Enable `shape_manifest.json` generation per shape/locale (prerequisite for [distill-integration.md](distill-integration.md))

**Out of scope:** This reorganization does NOT change:
- The content or structure of any `export.json` file
- Any SFDMU plan logic or composite key patterns
- CML blob files or constraint CSV content
- Context plan content
- The `cumulusci.yml` flow/task logic (only path options change)

## 5. Decision Rationale — Per Folder

### `constraints/qb/` → `sfdmu/qb/en-US/constraints/`

**Reason:** CML data is QB-shape-specific — `QuantumBitComplete` and `Server2` are expression set models built for the QuantumBit product catalog. They have no meaning outside of a QB org. Moving them inside the QB shape folder makes the shape self-contained: everything needed to fully reconstruct a QB org lives in one folder tree. The `rlm_cml.py` task already accepts a configurable path — this is a one-line default change.

When MFG develops CML data, it goes in `sfdmu/mfg/en-US/constraints/`. This pattern is now consistent.

### `procedure-plans/` + `scratch_data/` → `sfdmu/_shared/`

**Reason:** Both are shape-agnostic. `procedure-plans` contains metadata (ProcedurePlanSection + ProcedurePlanOption) that applies regardless of whether you're running QB, Q3, or MFG. `scratch_data` is generic Account + Contact seed data. The underscore prefix signals "not a shape folder." Any future shape that needs procedure plans references `_shared/procedure-plans/` — no duplication.

### `reconcile/`, `extractions/`, `test/`, `_archived/` → `sfdmu/_tooling/`

**Reason:** These are not production data — they are development and validation infrastructure. `reconcile/` contains round-trip validation snapshots. `extractions/` contains point-in-time extraction outputs. `test/` contains fixture data. None of these should be deployed to an org or referenced by production flows. Grouping under `_tooling/` makes the distinction explicit. CCI production flows will never reference `_tooling/`.

### `context_plans/` — stays at `datasets/` level

**Reason:** Context definitions are managed through the Context Service API, not SFDMU. They are a different data type entirely, managed by `rlm_context_service.py` and `rlm_extend_stdctx.py`. They are genuinely cross-shape — `ConstraintEngineNodeStatus` applies to any Revenue Cloud org regardless of product model. Pulling them into a shape folder would be incorrect. Internal cleanup: rename `archive/` → `_archive/` and create `_shared/` for the active plans.

### `shape_manifest.json` — added to each locale folder

**Reason:** One manifest per shape/locale, covering all plans in that folder. Generated by `generate_baseline_manifest` CCI task from the existing `export.json` files. Committed to git and updated whenever data plans change. Status values: `active` (ready), `partial` (incomplete coverage, like `qb/ja`), `pending` (needs v5 migration, like `q3/en-US`), `draft` (in development, like `mfg/en-US`). Distill integration depends on these manifests for drift detection.

### `shapes.json` — new at `datasets/` level

**Reason:** A single registry that answers: what shapes exist, what flags activate them, what locale variants are available, and which ones are ready for manifest generation. Consumed by the `capture_org_customizations` task and the `generate_baseline_manifest` task. Also serves as documentation for anyone trying to understand the data plan landscape.

## 7. CumulusCI Path Changes Required

All path changes are in task option defaults — no flow logic changes needed.

### `cumulusci.yml` Option Defaults

| Task | Option | Old Default | New Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `import_cml` | `dataset_path` | `datasets/constraints/qb` | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/constraints` |
| `export_cml` | `dataset_path` | `datasets/constraints/qb` | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/constraints` |
| `validate_cml` | `dataset_path` | `datasets/constraints/qb` | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/constraints` |
| `insert_scratch_data` | `data_folder` | `datasets/sfdmu/scratch_data` | `datasets/sfdmu/_shared/scratch_data` |
| `insert_procedure_plans_data` | `data_folder` | `datasets/sfdmu/procedure-plans` | `datasets/sfdmu/_shared/procedure-plans` |
| `capture_org_customizations` *(new)* | `baseline_manifest_path` | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/baseline_manifest.json` | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/shape_manifest.json` |

### `tasks/rlm_cml.py`

```python
# Before
DEFAULT_DATASET_PATH = "datasets/constraints/qb"

# After
DEFAULT_DATASET_PATH = "datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/constraints"
```

### `tasks/rlm_sfdmu.py`

Check for any hardcoded references to:
- `datasets/sfdmu/scratch_data` → `datasets/sfdmu/_shared/scratch_data`
- `datasets/sfdmu/procedure-plans` → `datasets/sfdmu/_shared/procedure-plans`
- `datasets/sfdmu/reconcile` → `datasets/sfdmu/_tooling/reconcile`

### `scripts/` and `docs/`

Any hardcoded paths in:
- `scripts/post_process_extraction.py`
- `scripts/compare_sfdmu_content.py`
- `scripts/reconcile_detail_qb_tax_billing_rating_rates.py`
- [docs/constraints_setup.md](constraints_setup.md)
- [README.md](../README.md)

---

## 8. Migration Steps

> **Branch:** All work on `distill-integration` branch.
> **Estimated effort:** ~2 hours including testing.

### Step 1: Create new directories
```bash
mkdir -p datasets/sfdmu/_shared
mkdir -p datasets/sfdmu/_tooling
mkdir -p datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/constraints
mkdir -p datasets/sfdmu/mfg/en-US/constraints
mkdir -p datasets/context_plans/_shared
mkdir -p datasets/context_plans/_archive
```

### Step 2: Move constraints into QB shape
```bash
# Move CML data
mv datasets/constraints/qb/QuantumBitComplete \
   datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/constraints/
mv datasets/constraints/qb/Server2 \
   datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/constraints/
mv datasets/constraints/README.md \
   datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/constraints/README.md

# Remove now-empty constraints directory
rmdir datasets/constraints/qb
rmdir datasets/constraints
```

### Step 3: Move cross-shape plans to `_shared/`
```bash
mv datasets/sfdmu/procedure-plans  datasets/sfdmu/_shared/
mv datasets/sfdmu/scratch_data     datasets/sfdmu/_shared/
```

### Step 4: Move tooling folders to `_tooling/`
```bash
mv datasets/sfdmu/_archived   datasets/sfdmu/_tooling/
mv datasets/sfdmu/extractions datasets/sfdmu/_tooling/
mv datasets/sfdmu/reconcile   datasets/sfdmu/_tooling/
mv datasets/sfdmu/test        datasets/sfdmu/_tooling/
```

### Step 5: Clean up context_plans
```bash
mv datasets/context_plans/archive \
   datasets/context_plans/_archive
mkdir -p datasets/context_plans/_shared
mv datasets/context_plans/ConstraintEngineNodeStatus \
   datasets/context_plans/_shared/
```

### Step 6: Update path defaults in code
- `tasks/rlm_cml.py` — update `DEFAULT_DATASET_PATH`
- `cumulusci.yml` — update task option defaults (see §7)
- `tasks/rlm_sfdmu.py` — check for hardcoded paths
- `scripts/*.py` — update any hardcoded references

### Step 7: Create `datasets/shapes.json`
```bash
# Create registry (content in §9 below)
touch datasets/shapes.json
```

### Step 8: Run validation
```bash
cci task run validate_setup
cci task run validate_cml
# Smoke test a data load with --dry-run or simulation mode
```

### Step 9: Update documentation
- [README.md](../README.md) — update any path references
- [docs/constraints_setup.md](constraints_setup.md) — update CML path references
- [docs/project-analysis.md](project-analysis.md) — paths already reflect new structure

---

## 9. Prerequisites for Shape Manifest Generation

Once the reorganization is complete, shape manifests can be generated.

### `datasets/shapes.json` (initial content)

```json

  "$schema": "https://rlm-base.schema/shapes/v1",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "last_updated": "2026-02-27",

### Generating `shape_manifest.json` for `qb/en-US`

Once the reorganization is complete, run:
```bash
cci task run generate_baseline_manifest \
  --org dev \
  --option shape_id qb-en-US
```

This reads all `export.json` files under `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/`, extracts the complete object/field/key inventory, and writes `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/shape_manifest.json`.

See [distill-integration.md §5](distill-integration.md#5-shape-manifest-data-model-design) for the full manifest schema design.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| CML import task uses old path, fails on run | High (if not caught) | High | Update `rlm_cml.py` default + add validation in `validate_setup` |
| SFDMU task hardcodes scratch_data path | Medium | Medium | Grep `tasks/rlm_sfdmu.py` for literal path strings before migration |
| README / doc references become stale | High | Low | Update README.md and constraints_setup.md as part of Step 9 |
| q3 plans broken by `_tooling` separation | None | None | q3 plans don't move — only tooling folders move |
| CI/CD references old paths | Low (no CI currently) | Low | Note for when GitHub Actions are added |
| reconcile/ scripts reference old paths | Medium | Low | Update `scripts/reconcile_*.py` path constants |
